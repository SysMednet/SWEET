# SWEEET
Sample-specific weighted correlation network (SWEET) method is desinged to model SINs by integrating the genome-wide sample weight with the differential correlation between the perturbed and aggregate networks.

## Input File Formats
- Gene expression matrix (tab-delimited):
    * Column: Samples
    * Row: Genes
- Samples of interest: seperate with `\n`
- Genes of interest: seperate with `\n`

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python3. Additionally, the following package must also be installed:
- Numpy

## Basic Usage
The example datasets are stored inside example folder, as well the example outputs.  
Step 1: calculate genome-wide sample weight:
```
python3 1.SWEET_sample_weight_calculating.py -f ./example/expression.txt -s ./example/weight.txt
```

`-h`: Get help with the commands  
`-f`: A path to "gene expression matrix" file  
`-k`: Balance parameter  
`-s`: A path to the output "sample weight" file  

Step 2: calculate confidence scores of edges between given genes for each sample of interest:
```
python3 2.SWEET_edge_score_calculating.py -f ./example/expression.txt -w ./example/weight.txt -p ./example/patient.txt -g ./example/gene.txt -s ./example
```

`-h`: Get help with the commands  
`-f`: A path to "gene expression matrix" file  
`-w`: A path to "sample weight" file (i.e., the output file from step 1)  
`-p`: A path to "samples of interest" file  
`-g`: A path to "genes of interest" file  
`-s`: A path to the output "confidence scores of edges" files for each sample of interest

Step 3: calculate the significance level of the confidence score for the edge between any two genes by a z-test:
```
python3 3.SWEET_calculating_mean_std_zscore.py -p ./example/patient.txt -l  ./example -s ./example/mean_std.txt -z False
```

`-h`: Get help with the commands  
`-p`: A path to "samples of interest" file  
`-l`: A path to the "confidence scores of edges" file for each sample of interest (i.e., the output files from step 2)  
`-s`: A path to the output file(s)  
`-z`: Indicates whether the calculation of z score (Ture) or not (False)
